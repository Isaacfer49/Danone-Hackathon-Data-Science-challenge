Within this collection, you will come across two distinct notebooks. The initial notebook centers around data exploration, while the second notebook delves into the realm of models. However, it's worth noting that both notebooks lack thorough organization.

Throughout my exploration, I experimented with various models, including xgboost, logistic regressions, and random forests. Based on my assessment, random forests exhibited superior performance.
