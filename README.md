# Danone-Hackathon-Data-Science-challenge
Within this collection, you will come across two distinct notebooks. The initial notebook centers around data exploration, while the second notebook delves into the realm of models. However, it's worth noting that both notebooks lack thorough organization.

Throughout my exploration, I experimented with various models, including xgboost, logistic regressions, and random forests. Based on my assessment, random forests exhibited superior performance.

To address nested aggregations, I employed one hot encoders and multilabel binarizers. These techniques allowed me to handle complex data structures effectively. While working on my models, I recognized the potential benefits of extracting additional variables that could enhance their performance. Regrettably, time constraints prevented me from pursuing this avenue further. :(
